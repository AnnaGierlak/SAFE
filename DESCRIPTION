Title: Surrogate-assisted feature extraction
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R:
    c(person("Anna", "Gierlak", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "anna.gierlak@op.pl"),
      person("Przemyslaw", "Biecek", role = c("aut", "ths")))
Description: A model agnostic tool for making an interpretable
  white-box model more accurate using alternative black-box model called surrogate model.
  Based on the complicated model, such as neural network or random forest, new features
  are being extracted and then used in the process of fitting a simpler interpretable model,
  improving its overall performance.
