Title: Surrogate-Assisted Feature Extraction in R
Version: 0.1.2
Authors@R:
    c(person("Alicja", "Gosiewska", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "alicjagosiewska@gmail.com"),

      person("Przemyslaw", "Biecek", role = c("aut", "ths")))
Description: Provides a model agnostic tool for making an explainable
  white-box model more accurate using alternative black-box model called surrogate model.
  Based on the complicated model, such as neural network or random forest, new features
  are being extracted and then used in the process of fitting a simpler explainable model,
  improving its overall performance.
