# SAFE - Surrogate Assisted Feature Extraction
The `SAFE` package is a model agnostic tool for making an interpretable white-box model more accurate using alternative black-box model called surrogate model. Based on the complicated model, such as neural network or random forest, new features are being extracted and then used in the process of fitting a simpler interpretable model, improving its overall performance.


# Getting started
The package can be installed from GitHub using the code below:
```
devtools::install_github("MI2DataLab/SAFE")
```
