\title{Creating SAFE extractor - an object used for surrogate-assisted feature extraction}
\usage{
safe_extraction(explainer, package = "changepoint.np",
  response_type = "ale", verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{explainer}{DALEX explainer created with explain() function}

\item{package}{character, a package used to compute breakpoints in case of continuous variables,
one of: "changepoint.np", "strucchange"}

\item{response_type}{character, type of response to be calculated, one of: "pdp", "ale".
If features are uncorrelated, one can use "pdp" type - otherwise "ale" is strongly recommended.}

\item{verbose}{logical, if progress bar is to be printed}
}
\value{
safe_extractor object containing information about variables transformation
}
\description{
The safe_extractiob() function creates a SAFE-extractor object which may be used later
for surrogate feature extraction.
